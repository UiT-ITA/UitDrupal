Resources and apps goes here, is separate subdirs. They are not deployed anywhere before they are included in a `<cluster>/RAIL/<app>/kustomization.yaml file.


*Note:* All defined resources in this dir are deployed, regardless of whether it's in a single manifest.yml file or in separate files. This means you can sort them in files and folders as you see fit.
